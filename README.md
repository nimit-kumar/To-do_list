## 📝 To-Do List (Command-Line Python App)

A simple and interactive **To-Do List application** built using **Python**. It allows users to **add**, **view**, and **remove** tasks via a text-based menu system, with input validation and clean user prompts.

### 📌 Features

* ✅ Add new tasks
* ✅ Display current list of tasks
* ✅ Remove a task by its serial number
* ✅ Input validation (e.g., non-integer handling)
* ✅ User-friendly messages and formatting
* ✅ Exit the app cleanly with confirmation

---

### 💻 Technologies Used

* **Language**: Python 3
* **IDE**: Any (VS Code, PyCharm, IDLE, etc.)
* **Concepts**: `while` loop, `list`, `input/output`, `try-except`, `enumerate()`
